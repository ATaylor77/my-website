    <h1> Austin Taylor</h1>
    <p> I am an aspiring IT student currently studying to get my AAST in IT Security.</p>
    <main>
        <p>Some of my work experience includes: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Retail</li>
            <li>Security</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>More about me!</h2>
        <p><a href="HTML/Interests.html"> Here </a> is a link to a page about my personal interests! </p>
        <!-- I like the idea of having multiple HTML pages to seperate out content, I want to include more of these in the future.-->
        <p>I was born and raised in Georgia and have moved arounf the United States a lot when I was a kid. Being in a
            military family will lead to a lot of moving around! Once I graduated high school, I have held lots of
            retail jobs, but have always had a passion for technology. Hence why I am looking into a degree in IT
            security!</p>
