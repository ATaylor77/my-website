            <h2>More about me!</h2>
            <p>I was born and raised in Georgia and have moved around the United States a lot when I was a kid. Being in
                a
                military family will lead to a lot of moving around! Once I graduated high school, I have held lots of
                retail jobs, as well as security and catering, but have always had a passion for technology and
                computers. Hence why I am looking into a degree in IT
                security!</p>

            <h2>An example of my writing!</h2>
            <p><a href="HTML/article.html">Here</a> is a link to one of my creative writing pieces! I used to do a lot
                of creative writing, it's very fun. It translates well into being a Dungeon Master when playing Dungeons
                and Dragons.</p>
