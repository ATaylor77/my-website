            <h2> A brief summary about me!</h2>
            <p>I was born and raised in Georgia and have moved around the United States a lot. Being in
                a
                military family will lead to a lot of moving around! I eventually ended up landing here in Washington
                State! Once I graduated high school, I have held lots of
                retail, security and catering jobs. I have always had a passion for technology and
                computers. Hence why I am looking into a degree in IT!</p>
