    <p> I have done a lot of creative writing, I really got into it senior year of high school, when we had a creative
        writing project. I was tasked with creating a piece of writing that was only meant to be four pages long, and I
        went twelve. Looking back, it was probably not what my teacher would have prefered, but I fell in love with
        creative writing thanks to her!</p>

    <p> Natuarlly this helped me really discover and get into Dungeons and Dragons as a hobby. I love the
        creative
        aspect of it. I spent countless hours creating worlds for my players to explore, as well as pour numerous days
        concocting elaborate back stories for my characters. <a
            href="https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/dungeons-and-dragons.php" target="=_blank"> Here</a> a link to
        one of favorite sites for character name ideas!</p>

    <p> I have always been a nerd. I love things like D&amp;D, gaming and other nerd culture related things. One of my
        favorite video games of all time is "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time." Something about the hero Link's
        coming of age story, and how he needs to wrestle with growing up and taking on the evils of the world really
        spoke to me as a kid.</p>
