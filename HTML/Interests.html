        <h2> My Hobbies</h2>
        <p> I have done a lot of creative writing, I really got into it senior year of high school, when we had a
            creative
            writing project. I was tasked with creating a piece of writing that was only meant to be four pages
            long,
            and I
            went twelve. Looking back, it was probably not what my teacher would have prefered, but I fell in love
            with
            creative writing thanks to her!</p>

        <p> Natuarlly this helped me really discover and get into Dungeons and Dragons as a hobby. I love the
            creative
            aspect of it. I spent countless hours creating worlds for my players to explore, as well as pour
            numerous
            days
            concocting elaborate back stories for my characters. <a
                href="https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/dungeons-and-dragons.php" target="=_blank"> Here</a> a
            link
            to
            one of favorite sites for character name ideas!</p>

        <p> I have always been a nerd. I love things like D&amp;D, gaming and other nerd culture related things. One
            of
            my
            favorite video games of all time is "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time." Something about the hero
            Link's
            coming of age story, and how he needs to wrestle with growing up and taking on the evils of the world
            really
            spoke to me as a kid.</p>
