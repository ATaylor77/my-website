    <p> I have had lots of pets growing up and still do! Below are images of some of my current pets. We have had lots
        of different breeds of animal. Ranging from Pit Bulls to labs, and all manner of cat! We even had a snake as
        well as a bearder dragon at one point!</p>

    <p> I love animals of all kinds and would persue Wildlife Biology as a degree if I wasn't persuing IT!</p>
