        <h1> My Work history!</h1>
        <p>I have done all sorts of work in my professional career thus far. I have done things from being a retail
            cashier, to handling materials and loading trucks. As well as doing things like asset protection. I even
            worked at a game development studio! Contracted to provide catered food and stock pantries and shelves with
            snacks and drinks for the development team!</p>

        <p>My time at Old Navy, while also working at Dick's Sporting Goods, was a time I saw the most career
            development. I was working 30 or so hours a week at both jobs, but my career in asset protection really took
            off then. I eventually moved and more or less got a promotion to Asset Protection Specialist with Fred
            Meyer. I eventually found a lot less stressful of a job catering at ISS Guckenhiemer. This being a the
            catering job at the Riot Games offices in Bellevue!</p>

        <h3>My current Job</h3>
        <p> I am currently working full time as a production team member at Evergreen Goodwill. I take items that are
            donated and I evaluate them on thier value, price them, and put them out for sale! </p>

        <p> I used to work in donations however, that was where my career with Evergreen Goodwill got started. I will
            include a picture below to help give you and idea of how busy it could get. I eventually got transferred
            over to
            production! A
            position that I had wanted since I got my start with the company.</p>
