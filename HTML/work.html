    <p> I am currentyly working full time as a production team member at Evergreen Goodwill. I take items that are
        donated and I evaluate them on thier value, price them, and put them out for sale! </p>

    <p> I used to work in donations however, that was where my carrer with Evergreen Goodwill got started. I will
        include a picture below to help give you and idea of how busy it could get. I eventually got transferred over to
        production! A
        position that I had wanted since I got my start with the company.</p>
