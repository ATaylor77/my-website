        <h1> My Work history!</h1>
        <p>I have done all sorts of work in my professional career thus far. I have done things from being a retail
            cashier, to handling materials and loading trucks. As well as doing things like asset protection. I even
            worked at a game development studio! Contracted to provide catered food and stock pantries and shelves with
            snacks and drinks for the development team!</p>
        <h3>My work experience includes things like: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Retail</li>
            <li>Security</li>
            <li>Asset Protection</li>
            <li>Catering</li>
            <li>Material Handling</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>My current Job</h3>
        <p> I am currently working full time as a production team member at Evergreen Goodwill. I take items that are
            donated and I evaluate them on thier value, price them, and put them out for sale! </p>

        <p> I used to work in donations however, that was where my career with Evergreen Goodwill got started. I will
            include a picture below to help give you and idea of how busy it could get. I eventually got transferred
            over to
            production! A
            position that I had wanted since I got my start with the company.</p>
