        <h1>An example of my writing!</h1>
        <p>I used to do a lot of creative writing, it's very fun. I actually don't have a lot of free time anymore. It
            does translate well into being a Dungeon Master when playing Dungeons and Dragons however. Below I have
            included and exerpt from a piece I did not too long ago. It is the opening to my longest piece of writing to
            date.</p>

    <h1>My First Piece</h1>
    <article>
        <p>Winter has always been harsh in the northern regions of Kalmadra. Winter has just begun. Snow falls ever so
            slowly to the ground. The sun is just rising on the horizon, poking its rays of light through the branches
            of
            the pine trees. Off in a clearing, lightly dusted with a thin layer of fresh snow, a small herd of deer
            graze
            very cautiously. Birds chirp and sing their joyous songs, floating about carefree from tree to tree. All
            seems
            peaceful, the forest is dense, but not intraversable. A hunter, young and naive, clad in hides, steeped in
            pine
            branches, is approaching the clearing. Eyes on his mark, a whitetail buck, he’s large and would feed his
            small
            village for a few days.</p>

        <p>As he approaches the treeline, the birds go quiet, something is wrong. The hunter is unperturbed by the
            sudden
            silence, as are the deer. The only sound to be heard are the occasional, light sounds of snow crunching
            underfoot as the deer move from one spot to another. Then, as sudden and as jarring as glass shattering,
            movement. On the opposite side of the clearing. The movement is quiet, but in the silence of the clearing,
            it's
            as if the very earth shook. The deer all lift their heads in unison, looking in the direction of the noise.
            There is no visible entity in the treeline, but it’s very apparent that something is there. Then, there is
            even
            more movement, from what seems like all around the clearing, leaves being rustled, snow being crushed but...
            As
            sudden as the commotion started, it stopped.</p>

        <p>Minutes pass, but they feel like hours. The hunter feels as though he is being watched, and gets very uneasy.
            Sweat begins to swell on his brow, even in below freezing temperatures. On the other side of the clearing,
            he
            spots something… Out of the realms of what he thought could be possible. Walking bones. Clad in chainmail,
            with
            dark mist seeping out from between the links in its armor very gently. As if there was a dark storm brewing
            under its steel linked shell. A figure approaches from behind the walking skeleton, even more horrifying. A
            man,
            or what once was a man, wearing very tattered, dark robes. His face is sunken and gaunt, like he hasn't seen
            an
            ounce of food, or sunlight in a millennia. His eyes glow a faint green color, his skin pale as the bone
            cadaver
            standing in front of him. This man is beyond life and death, He is somewhere in between.</p>

        <p>Suddenly, his head snaps to attention and makes eye contact with the young hunter. "You're next. Heed the
            call
            of the damned." His voice boomed almost sourcelessly. The being points and lets out a loud otherworldly, and
            terrifying screech. A horrible chill overtakes the young hunter. Followed by a horrible searing pain on his
            right shoulder. More walking monstrosities begin to emerge from the brush and shamble into the clearing. The
            helpless deer all scatter in fear and run for any openings in the trees. The figures seem to have no
            interest in
            them.</p>
